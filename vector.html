    For the Vector project, we have to create a character or a creature from our photoshop image. With the effect from the picture and a overlooking city, I knew I needed a moster for the city. Originally, it was not Cthulhu, the more i worked on my original creature it slowly turned into Cthulhu. No one can resist the power of Cthulhu.
